I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead.

- [x] Task 1 (done)
- [x] Task 2 (also done)
- [ ] Task 3 (not done yet)

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

Things can also be ~~crossed out~~, if necessary.
